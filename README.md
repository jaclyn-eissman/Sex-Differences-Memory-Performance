# Sex-specific genetic architecture of late-life memory performance.

## Abstract
BACKGROUND: Women demonstrate a memory advantage when cognitively healthy yet lose this advantage to men in Alzheimer’s disease. However, the genetic underpinnings of this sex difference in memory performance remain unclear.

METHODS: We conducted the largest sex-aware genetic study on late-life memory to date (N</Males>=11,942; N</Females>=15,641). Leveraging harmonized memory composite scores from four cohorts of cognitive aging and AD, we performed sex-stratified and sex-interaction genome-wide association studies in 24,216 non-Hispanic White and 3,367 non-Hispanic Black participants. 

RESULTS: We identified three sex-specific loci (rs67099044 – _CBLN2_, rs719070 – _SCHIP1_/_IQCJ-SCHIP_), including an X-chromosome locus (rs5935633 – EGL6/TCEANC/OFD1), that associated with memory. Additionally, we identified heparan sulfate signaling as a sex-specific pathway and found sex-specific genetic correlations between memory and cardiovascular, immune, and education traits.

DISCUSSION: This study showed memory is highly and comparably heritable across sexes, as well as highlighted novel sex-specific genes, pathways, and genetic correlations that related to late-life memory.
